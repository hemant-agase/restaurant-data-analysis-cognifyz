# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis Project

Hey there! In this project, I'm excited to walk you through a restaurant dataset I worked on during my Data Analysis Internship with **Cognifyz Technologies**. It's packed with information about thousands of restaurants from around the world, and my goal was to explore it, clean it, and extract meaningful insights — just like a real data analyst would in the industry.

---

## 📘 Project Background

This project is based on a real-world restaurant dataset that includes detailed information about **9,500+ restaurants** operating across **15 countries** and **141 cities worldwide**. It captures a wide variety of restaurant-related attributes such as names, locations, cuisines served, pricing, customer ratings, delivery and booking services, and more.

The dataset serves as the foundation for performing both basic and advanced data analysis tasks. It allows us to explore various dimensions of the food industry — from identifying top cuisines and affordable areas, to analyzing the effect of online services and customer engagement through ratings and votes.

This analysis is conducted as part of the **Data Analysis Internship Program by Cognifyz Technologies**, a company known for delivering cutting-edge data science and AI solutions. The core objective of the internship is to help aspiring data analysts gain hands-on experience by working on real datasets. Interns are required to apply key skills such as data cleaning, visualization, feature exploration, and insight generation to answer business-driven questions.

The goal of this project is not just to summarize the data but to **derive actionable insights** that reflect **customer preferences**, **pricing behavior**, **popular cuisines**, and **service availability trends** — all of which can help food delivery platforms or restaurants make better strategic decisions.

## 🎯 Internship Task Objectives (from Cognifyz Technologies)

During the internship, I worked on tasks across 3 levels. Here’s what I tackled:

### 🔹 Level 1: Basic EDA
- Identified top 3 cuisines and their percentages
- Found city with most restaurants
- Calculated city-wise and highest average rating
- Analyzed price range distribution
- Checked % of restaurants offering online delivery
- Compared delivery vs non-delivery ratings

### 🔸 Level 2: Intermediate Analysis
- Analyzed rating distribution and most common rating
- Calculated average votes
- Discovered popular cuisine combinations
- Plotted restaurant locations using coordinates
- Detected restaurant chains and compared ratings

### 🔺 Level 3: Deep-Dive Insights
- Analyzed review text sentiment & keyword trends (if available)
- Found restaurants with highest & lowest votes
- Explored vote–rating correlation
- Analyzed relationship between price range & services
